# Allotment_Backup
Demonstration of a offline backup of a tool I made for lining up portions of lots with orders as an extension of a customer's old system.

This demonstration contains modified elements of a customer's system into which this tool was grafted.  All data is random and exists to simulate use.  Access the tool using the "Allot Doses" button in either sheet.  This will set up grids by which the user can apportion doses from lots (the result of production) to customers based on their orders.  This left my client with the decision making power, but made the decision almost instantenous by putting all relevant information in one place.  To compile these decisions into "Customer Output," go back and click the button again.

This is admittedly an slightly annoying UI.  I put together this tool in a single afternoon to function as a backup in the case that the internet is unavailable for the customer and access is consequently lost to the more user friendly and aesthetic version of the product written in office scripts.  In the "online" version of the product which is not public, there are colors, buttons and other guides to facilitate the process.

I wanted to use this as a demo because the online product which it mirrors saves my customer hours a week and eliminated a bottleneck holding up an entire team.
Once again, all original data has been removed or randomized, and the data does not reflect the real industry of the customer.
